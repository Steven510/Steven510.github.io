For many years, I always dream of my website although I am not an IT engineer.
In 2023, it came true with helps from **Jekyll**. 
As a static website generator, it can transform your plain text into static websites and blogs as this website.

## Jekyll Study
------
Official website: [[English]](https://jekyllrb.com/) / [[Chinese]](http://jekyllcn.com/)

The best tutorial for me is the [[course]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB) from Giraffe Academy on Youtube.
After understanding Jekyll, it is also convenient for us to find some templates online. 
[[Jekyllthemes]](http://jekyllthemes.org/) / [[Github]](https://github.com/)
<!-- > Of course, you can also find the same contents in Chinese: [[Jekyll教程]](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1qs41157ZZ/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=515673d8eb75178f1383b55c530abb21) -->

Here, we use [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) on GitHub directly as the basic template. 
After reconstructing the origin navigation, I decided to slice my contents into four parts:
* Blog: Traveling, Thinking and Talking (Triple-T)
* Econ: Learning in the field of Economics and Econometrics
* Quan: Focus on the research of Quantitive Economics and Finance
* Python: Mainly about Python, sometimes including other coding works

Frankly speaking, I always felt confused at the beginning of learning something new. So if you find a problem on the website, please contact me through my email.
