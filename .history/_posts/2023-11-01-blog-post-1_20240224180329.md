For many years, I always dream of my website although I am not an IT engineer.
In 2023, it came true with Jekyll's help. 
As a static website generator, **Jekyll** can transform your plain text into static websites and blogs as this website.

### Jekyll Study
------
Official website: [[English]](https://jekyllrb.com/) / [[Chinese]](http://jekyllcn.com/)

The best tutorial for me is the [course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB) from Giraffe Academy on Youtube.
<!-- > Of course, you can also find the same contents in Chinese: [[Jekyll教程]](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1qs41157ZZ/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=515673d8eb75178f1383b55c530abb21) -->

After understanding the basic elements of Jekyll, it is also convenient for us to find some Jekyll templates online.
