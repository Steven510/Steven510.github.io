This article introduces the basic packages we use to analyze data, Numpy, Pandas, SciPy and Matplotlib.

## Numpy: the cornerstone
As data analysts, we work by Numpy almost every day. 
It is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
Generally speaking, an object of a 2-D or 3-D matrix is enough for us to handle all the problems we face.
So, after importing the original data, I always deal with it under the type of np.ndarray.

## Pandas
Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.
