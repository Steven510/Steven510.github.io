This article introduces the basic packages we use to analyze data, Numpy, Pandas, SciPy and Matplotlib.

## [Numpy: the cornerstone](https://numpy.org/)
As data analysts, we work by Numpy almost every day. 
It is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
Generally speaking, an object of a 2-D or 3-D matrix is enough for us to handle all the problems we face.
So, after importing the original data, I always deal with it under the type of ndarray.

The key adventage of using ndarray in Python is the computing speed.
In original Python, built-in data structures can be divided into four types: 
- three mutable data structures: List, Dictionary, and Set
- one immutable data structure: Tuple
Comparing to List, The following are the main reasons behind the fast speed of Numpy.
- Numpy array is a collection of similar data-types that are densely packed in memory. A Python list can have different data-types, which puts lots of extra constraints while doing computation on it.
- Numpy is able to divide a task into multiple subtasks and process them parallelly.
- Numpy functions are implemented in C. Which again makes it faster compared to Python Lists.

## Pandas
Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.
