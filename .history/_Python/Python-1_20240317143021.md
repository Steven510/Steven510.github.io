This article introduces the basic packages we use to analyze data, Numpy, Pandas, SciPy and Matplotlib.

## Numpy: the very basic package for data analysis 
As data analysts, we work by Numpy almost everyday. 
It is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
Usually, when data were imported, I always deal with it with type of np.ndarray.
Generally speaking, a object of 2-D or 3-D matrix is enough for us to handle all problem we face.

## Pandas

Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.
