This article introduces the basic packages we use to analyze data, Numpy, Pandas, SciPy and Matplotlib.

## [Numpy: the cornerstone](https://numpy.org/)
As data analysts, we work by **Numpy** almost every day. 
It is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
Generally speaking, an object of a 2-D or 3-D matrix is enough for us to handle all the problems we face.
So, after importing the original data, I always deal with it under the type of ndarray.

The key adventage of using ndarray in Python is the computing speed.
In original Python, built-in data structures can be divided into four types: 
- three mutable data structures: **List**, **Dictionary**, and **Set**
- one immutable data structure: **Tuple**

Compared to **List**, the following are the main reasons behind the fast speed of **Numpy**, which I think as a good answer from Ferferite on stackoverflow.[[Reference]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63409324/why-numpy-array-is-faster-than-list-in-python)
- A ndarray is a collection of similar data types that are densely packed in memory. A Python list can have different data types, which puts lots of extra constraints while doing computation on it.
- **Numpy** is able to divide a task into multiple subtasks and process them parallelly.
- **Numpy** functions are implemented in C. Which again makes it faster compared to Python Lists.

So if you have speed issue of data analysis in Python, please try to solve it with **Numpy**.

In this library, you should remember that the basic element always a multidimensional array object or various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices).
Also, **Numpy** provides an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

Believe me or not, after you've tried to solve the data problem with **Numpy** once, the only question next time will be how to translate my data analysis problem into some ndarray operations.

## Pandas
Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.
